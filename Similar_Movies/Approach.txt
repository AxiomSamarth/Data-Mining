Preprocessing Step :

1. Firstly, I converted the JSON data into a csv data and employed pandas to handle it. 

2. Among all the given attributes of the movie, I think votes, ratings, genre, age of movie(current_year-release year) and metascore are significant enough to find similarity among movies.

3. For genre, in order to normalize it into single value, I found the number of common genres between the two movies under comparison and divided it by the total number of genres which both movies together have.

4. Wherever the metascore is NaN, I replaced it with 0

5. After doing this for each movie, I formed the numpy array of attributes for analysis.






Analysis:

1. I employed the Pearson Correlation Coefficient to find the similarity.

Correlation coefficient = dot_product of normalized attributes of p and q objects / (standard_deviation(p) * standard_deviation(q) * total number of attributes)

2. The coefficient that is found is stored as [movie_name, compared_with_movie_name, correlation_value]

3. Now all this 249 items (not compared with itself as correlatio would be 1) are sorted based on correlation_value in descending order and top 10 are chosen to be the top 10 similar movies in their decreasing order of their similarity.

4. This is done for all the 250 movies and written onto a file in the expected format as mentioned in the mail.
